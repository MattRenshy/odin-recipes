    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The secret to getting gloriously puffed-up Yorkshire puddings is to have the fat sizzling hot and don't open the oven door!</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>140g plain flour (this is about 200ml/7fl oz)</li>
        <li>4 eggs (200ml/7fl oz)</li>
        <li>200ml milk</li>
        <li>sunflower oil, for cooking</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oven to 230C/fan 210C/gas 8.</li>
        <li>Drizzle a little sunflower oil evenly into two 4-hole Yorkshire pudding tins or two 12-hole non-stick muffin tins and place in the oven to heat through.</li>
        <li>To make the batter, tip 140g plain flour into a bowl and beat in 4 eggs until smooth.</li>
        <li>Gradually add 200ml milk and carry on beating until the mix is completely lump-free. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Pour the batter into a jug, then remove the hot tins from the oven. Carefully and evenly pour the batter into the holes.</li>
        <li>Place the tins back in the oven and leave undisturbed for 20-25 mins until the puddings have puffed up and browned.</li>
    </ol>
